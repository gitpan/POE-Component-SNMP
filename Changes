0.01  Mon Apr 21 13:28:31 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-AX -n POE::Component::SNMP

0.90  Mon Jun  7 18:44:00 2004
        - Module inherited by Rob Bloodgood, from the previous
	  mainainer, Todd Caine.

	- added POE::Component::SNMP::Dispatcher module, to subclass
          Net::SNMP::Dispatcher such that all socket and scheduling
          operations were processed by POE's event loop.

	- updated the callback variables so that the hostname and
	  session alias of the SNMP object queried are returned to the
	  callback event.

	- made write tests optional during install, so that the module
          would install correctly even where a writeable host was
          unavailable.
