Revision history for Perl extension POE::Component::SNMP.

0.01  Mon Apr 21 13:28:31 2003
        - original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
                -AX -n POE::Component::SNMP

0.90  Mon Jun  7 18:44:00 2004
        - Module inherited by Rob Bloodgood, from the previous
          mainainer, Todd Caine.

        - added POE::Component::SNMP::Dispatcher module, to subclass
          Net::SNMP::Dispatcher such that all socket and scheduling
          operations were processed by POE's event loop.

        - updated the callback variables so that the hostname and
          session alias of the SNMP object queried are returned to the
          callback event.

        - made write tests optional during install, so that the module
          would install correctly even where a writeable host was
          unavailable.
        
0.92  Mon Sep  6 13:19:53 2004
        - Updated to be compatible with new Net::SNMP release 5.0.0

0.93  Thu Aug 11 11:57:29 2005
        - Updated POE session constructor from the deprecated new() to
          the new create() method.

        - Removed a bunch of commented, deprecated code that was still
          a holdover from the 0.01

0.94  Thu Mar 30 14:43:19 2006
        - Reorganized the module distribution to use a lib/ dir, cuz
          MakeMaker was being dumb.

        - Updated Makefile.PL to remove the config file on 'make
          realclean'

        - Tweaked the docs.

        - Altered the sample script in the SYNOPSIS to actually work.

        - Removed remaining commented references to deprecated code.

        - Followed a suggestion from Curtis J. Coleman to re-order
          component shutdown so that finish() worked correctly.

        - Lots of minor cleanups in the text

        - At LAST: removed the duplicate methods to account for the
          difference between Net::SNMP 4.x and 5.x.  Now this is
          achieved by aliasing the functions that need to be
          duplicated in the symbol table.

0.95  Sat Apr  8 14:46:54 PDT 2006
        - Collapsed all the identical method calls into a dispatch
          mechanism around a single method call template.

        - VASTLY improved error handling.

        - Added the snmp method (eg get, set, walk) and request args
          to the request packet returned to callbacks.

        - Reorganized Dispatcher.pm, trimmed old commented
          code. Removed unneeded debugging statements.

	- trimmed unnecessary parameters from calls to
          __invoke_callback().

        - added new tests for various aspects of error handling.
